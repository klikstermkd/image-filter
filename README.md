# image-filter

This is a an image filter app.

It uses React and Redux. Babel and Webpack are used to convert the code to ES5 and bundle it to single file.

To run the app, just open ```index.html``` which is inside the ```public``` directory.

If you want to play around with the code, follow these instructions:

1. If you haven't already installed Webpack, run: ```npm install -g webpack```
2. Install all required node modules with: ```npm install```
3. And finally start Webpack with: ```webpack -w```. The ```-w``` argument tells Webpack to listen on file change and update the bundle.
